Check extension verification.Tool Used: github.com/almandin/fuxploider 18. XXE Injection (XML External Entity Injection) Approach:\nUse XXE payloads in Intruder to detect. Check if the website is accepting content-type=text/xml header with a 200 OK response. Use online tool pingb.in to check for external ping. For blind XXE, use Python’s SimpleHTTPServer (e.g., python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80). SYSTEM file:///etc/passwd for local file read. SYSTEM http://systemip/readinganyfile for blind XXE. Use php:// for Remote Code Execution (RCE). Use Gopher or other URI handlers to exploit XXE.Common Places to Find XXE: XML file upload (e.g., config files) XML input fields XML-based APIs XML-based files (e.g., RSS, SVG)Tool Used: pingb.in / Burp Suite 19. Account Lockout Approach:\nPrevent brute-force attacks. Intercept the login page with user credentials using Burp Suite. Send the request to Sequencer. Alternatively, use Intruder to make multiple requests (e.g., 1000 times). Perform credential stuffing. Ensure the account locks out for 30 minutes to 24 hours.**** 20. Blind XSS Approach:\nA type of stored XSS where attacker input is saved in the server and stored in the database. It won’t be reflected immediately. Look for blind XSS in pages like: Contact us Log viewers Feedback pages Chat apps Ticket generation apps Any app using moderation or updates Saving forms Use the online tool xsshunter.com. Copy the payload and paste it in the input field. Reflection will be found on xsshunter.com. Perform multiple blind XSS using Intruder.**** / XSSHunter.com 21. Buffer Overflow (Web) Approach:\nIntercept the login page and pass a long string of passwords or other inputs. Observe if the page loads slowly. Types of overflows to consider: Buffer, Stack, Heap, Integer, Format String. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using buffer overflow can be attempted.**** 22. CMS Vulnerability Hunting Approach:\nTarget common CMS platforms: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, vBulletin, Magento. Identify vulnerable components within the CMS. Search for exploits using Google.Tools Used: WPScan, CMSMap, CMSSCAN, Joomscan, Drupwn, vBulletin Scanner, Mage Scanner, OWASP VBScan 23. IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References) Scenario 1:\nOften found in user settings or profile management. Requires two accounts. Intercept the request and change the email ID of the attacker. Log out and attempt to log in with the victim\u0026rsquo;s account to see if the change was successful. Scenario 2: User Moderation:\nFind the user ID. Replace the victim’s ID with the attacker’s ID. Perform the functionality to see if access is granted.**** 24. Long Password DoS Attack Approach:\nHashing passwords can be resource-intensive, leading to potential DoS. Similar to buffer overflow attacks but specifically targeting password fields without length limits. Sign up for an account and intercept the request. Input a password longer than the typical length and forward the request. This can cause application DoS.**** 25. No Rate Limiting Vulnerability (Logical Flow) Approach:\nCapture the forgot password page or any similar request with Burp Suite. Send the request to Intruder. Make multiple requests (e.g., 1000 times) to test for rate limiting issues. This can impact both user and server performance.**** 26. Password Reset Poisoning Approach:\nIntercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite. Perform a host header attack. The victim will receive a password reset email from an \u0026ldquo;evil\u0026rdquo; website specified in the host header.**** 27. Broken Access Control Approach:\nIDOR Example: Access with account 1: https://acme.com/changepw/id?=1234 Create a second account and access it: https://acme.com/changepw/id?=5678 Logout from account 1, log into account 2, and attempt to change the password of account 1 by modifying the user ID in the request. Hash-Based IDOR: User IDs might be hashed (e.g., Base64). Local File Inclusion (LFI) \u0026amp; Path Traversal: Example request: GET /view?pg=../../../../../etc/passwd%00 Common Parameters to Look For: id, user, account, number, order, no, doc, key, email, group, profile, edit Functions to Test: Change email, change password, upgrade/downgrade user role, create/remove/update/delete context-specific app data (e.g., shipping, invoices, document viewing). Missing Function Level Access Control: Forceful browsing (e.g., GET /admin/viewTransactions, GET /ADMIN/viewTransactions) Parameter Manipulation \u0026amp; Logic Bugs: Example: Giving a negative price. Logic Flow Vulnerabilities in E-commerce: Skipping steps in workflows (e.g., additem-\u0026gt;checkout-\u0026gt;enter shipping info-\u0026gt;payment). Tools Used: Burp Suite Extensions (AuthMatrix, AuthZ, Authorize, AutoRepeater)\n28. Account Takeover via Forgot Password Page Approach:\nIntercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite. Add X-Forwarded-Host: bing.com to the request header. Forward the request to test for account takeover vulnerabilities.**** 29. Broken Access Control Approach:\nCreate an account. Change the email ID from A to B. Generate a forgot password request for email A. Repeat the same process for passwords.**** 30. Rate Limiting Bypass Approach:\nIntercept the forgot password page with Burp Suite. Send the request to Intruder. Add X-Forwarded-Host: bing.com to the request header. Target the request to email and forward it to test for rate limiting bypass.**** 31. Lack of Password Confirmation Approach:\nRequired for actions such as deleting an account or changing an email ID. Verify that a password confirmation step is missing in these processes.**** 32. 2FA or OTP Bypass Approach:\nComplete the registration process and request an OTP code. Intercept the OTP request using Burp Suite. Send the intercepted request to Intruder. Bruteforce the 6-digit OTP through Burp Intruder if there’s no rate limiting or CAPTCHA. Analyze content length and attempt multiple combinations until bypassing OTP verification.**** 33. Blind SQL Injection Approach:\nCheck input fields and insert payloads such as id=1. Insert payloads in user-agent or other input parameters. Confirm by changing the time interval with payloads like: id=5+and+1=2 ',0)waitfor delay'0:0:05'-- if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(5),0)) -- (select(0)from(select(sleep(3)))v)/*'+(select(3)from(select(sleep(3)))v)+'\u0026quot;\u0026quot;+(select(0)from(select(sleep(3)))v)+\u0026quot;\u0026quot;*/ 0'XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(3),0))XOR'Z ' and extractvalue(1,concat(0x0a,@@version)) or**** or Cookie Manager 34. Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Approach:\nVisit the target website and create an account. Verify the email address and navigate to profile settings. Upload a malicious file (e.g., RCE.php%00.gif) as the company logo and save. View the uploaded image URL and append ?cmd=id to execute the id command. Scenario 2:\nCrawl the target website using Burp Suite. Check for /cgi-bin/status. Send to Repeater and replace User-Agent with payload like {:;};echo $(\u0026lt;/etc/passwd). Send the request to see if it reveals root user info.**** or Manual 35. Stealing OAuth Token Approach:\nLog in using a third-party app (e.g., Facebook, Gmail). Intercept the request using Burp Suite. Modify redirect_url to a domain you control (e.g., bugbountypoc.com). If necessary, change the referer header to the same domain.**** 36. External Service Interaction Approach:\nCapture the request using Burp Suite. Send the request to Repeater. Replace Host header with Burp Collaborator payload or add a new X-Forwarded-For header with the same payload. Forward the request and check if Burp Collaborator receives a DNS lookup request.**** 37. Server-Side Include (SSI) Injection Approach:\nIntercept the request using Burp Suite. Spider the target host. Search for pages with .shtml extensions. Inject payloads like \u0026lt;!--#echo var=\u0026quot;DATE_LOCAL\u0026quot; --\u0026gt; into input fields. Forward the request and check the response for injected data.**** 38. Client and Server-Side Template Injection Approach:\nCheck if user input is reflected on the webpage. Insert payloads to test for template injection. Common Template Engines: FreeMarker (Java-based) Velocity (Java-based) Smarty (PHP-based) Twig (PHP-based) Jade (Node.js-based) Jinja2 (Python/Flask-based) Manual Checking:\nExample Payloads: curl -g '\u0026lt;http://www.target.com/page?name=John'\u0026gt; curl -g '\u0026lt;http://www.target.com/page?name={{7*7}\u0026gt;}' Automation Tool:\nhttps://github.com/epinna/tplmap Basic Payloads:\n{{7*7}} {{7*'7'}} {% extends \u0026quot;/etc/passwd\u0026quot; %} RCE Payload (Twig):\n{{_self.env.registerUndefinedFilterCallback(\u0026quot;exec\u0026quot;)}}{{_self.env.getFilter(\u0026quot;id\u0026quot;)}}Tool Used: Manual Checking, curl, tplmap 39. Exif GeoLocation Data Not Stripped Approach:\nDownload an image from https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples. Go to JPG properties and check GPS data. Upload the image to the target website. Copy the image URL and paste it into an EXIF data tool (e.g., http://metapicz.com/).Tool Used: Exif.regex.info/exif.cgi 40. CRLF Injection Approach:\nCapture a request using Burp Suite. Insert arbitrary data in the input field (e.g., aaaaaaaaaaaaa). If the input is reflected in the response header, it may be vulnerable. Test Carriage Return (%0A) and Linefeed (%0D) payloads. Example Payload: %0a%0dxxxxxxxxxxxxx return_url=aaaa%0a%0dset-cookie:mycookie**** ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*wBuE9-f32uHnqH9Sq4EFiQ.png","permalink":"https://orangeymango.me/p/bug-bounty-essentials-a-comprehensive-cheatsheet/","title":"Bug Bounty Essentials - A Comprehensive Cheatsheet"},{"content":"Payloads for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability commonly found in web applications. It occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious scripts (typically written in JavaScript) into web pages viewed by other users. This can happen when user input is not properly validated or sanitized by the application before being displayed to other users.\nThere are several types of XSS attacks:\nStored XSS: Also known as persistent XSS, this occurs when the injected script is permanently stored on the target server, such as in a database or a file. Whenever a user visits the affected page, the malicious script is executed. Reflected XSS: In this type of attack, the injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message or search result. The attacker typically tricks a victim into clicking on a specially crafted link that contains the malicious payload. DOM-based XSS: This occurs when the client-side script modifies the DOM (Document Object Model) in an unsafe way, leading to a XSS vulnerability. Unlike traditional XSS attacks, DOM-based XSS does not involve the server-side code. XSS attacks can have serious consequences, including:\nTheft of sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and login credentials. Manipulation of user sessions and actions. Defacement of websites. Distribution of malware to other users. Redirection to malicious websites. Compromise of user privacy.

Recommendation: To mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, the following recommendations are provided:\nImplement strict input validation mechanisms to filter out potentially malicious input. Utilize output encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping) to render user-supplied data safely. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and mitigate XSS risks. Conduct regular security assessments, including code reviews and penetration tests, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. Educate developers on secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of XSS vulnerabilities in future development efforts. The identified XSS vulnerabilities pose a significant threat to the security. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of users\u0026rsquo; browsers, leading to various security risks, including data theft and unauthorized access. It is imperative that immediate action is taken to address these vulnerabilities and implement the recommended mitigation strategies to safeguard the application against XSS attacks.\n","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://blogdetectify.cdn.triggerfish.cloud/uploads/2015/12/04174531/What-is-Cross-site-Scripting-XSS-and-how-can-you-fix-it_.png","permalink":"https://orangeymango.me/p/cross-site-scripting-xss-payloads-and-mitigation-strategies/","title":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Payloads and Mitigation Strategies"},{"content":"Low Level Functionality Check: Application accepts input in ip parameter, directly passed to shell_exec().

It demonstrates how an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system through the vulnerability. By injecting specially crafted commands, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the system. This unauthorized access can lead to further exploitation, such as data theft, system compromise, or launching other attacks. It\u0026rsquo;s crucial to emphasize that exploiting vulnerabilities without proper authorization is both illegal and unethical.
